My research is centered on harnessing the power of `Human Computer Interaction (HCI)` with `Machine Learning (ML)` to drive innovation within the `healthcare` sector. Fueled by an unwavering enthusiasm for AI technologies, my goal is to significantly improve the precision, efficiency, and capabilities of `consumer health products`.

As a `fourth-year undergraduate` in the Information and Computer Science (ICS) Honors program, advised by Dr. Mohammad Moshirpour, I pursue a `dual major in Computer Science and Informatics`. I will attend `Master of Science in Computer Science` at `Northwestern University` in Fall 2024 and seeking `Ph.D. opportunities` for `Fall 2026`.

I enjoy `global travel`, `Japanese anime`, playing `Overwatch`, and aim to be more active. I also lead a subtitle group in China, [`BelugaSubs`](https://www.belugasubs.com), aiming to share diverse global stories with Chinese audiences.
