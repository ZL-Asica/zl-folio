I am a `first-year MSCS student` at `Northwestern University`, specializing in `Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)` and `Ubiquitous Computing`. My research focuses on `intelligent interactive systems`—how computational models can enhance human experiences through adaptive, context-aware technologies.

My work spans `interaction modeling`, `multimodal data processing`, and `efficient ML-driven interfaces`, aiming to bridge `human-centered design with scalable computational methods`. I am particularly interested in how `ubiquitous sensing` and `AI-driven interaction` can improve `everyday computing environments`.

I earned `honors degrees` in `Computer Science` and `Informatics` from `UC Irvine`, where I conducted research on information retrieval, interactive system design, and computational methods for behavioral analysis. I am currently exploring `PhD` opportunities for `Fall 2026` to further my research in intelligent interaction and ubiquitous computing.
