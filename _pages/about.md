I am a `first-year MSCS student` at `Northwestern University`, personally focusing on `Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)` and `Machine Learning (ML)` to drive transformative innovation in the `healthcare` sector. My academic focus is on leveraging these technologies to advance the precision, efficiency, and capabilities of `consumer health products`.

With a deep passion for healthcare technologies, I am dedicated to contributing to the development of cutting-edge solutions that can positively impact patient outcomes and overall healthcare experiences.

During my undergraduate studies, I earned an honors degree with a dual major in Computer Science and Informatics. Outside of my academic pursuits, I am an avid enthusiast of `traveling`, `Japanese anime`, and `exploring pâtisserie`. As I continue my academic journey, I am also actively seeking `PhD opportunities` for `Fall 2026`.
