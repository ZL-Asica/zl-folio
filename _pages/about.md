I am a `first-year MSCS student` at `Northwestern University`, with a focus on `Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)` and `Machine Learning (ML)` to drive innovation in the `healthcare` sector. My passion for AI technologies fuels my goal to enhance the precision, efficiency, and capabilities of `consumer health products`.

During my undergraduate studies, I earned an honors degree with a dual major in Computer Science and Informatics. Outside of academics, I enjoy `traveling`, `Japanese anime`, and `exploring pâtisserie`. I'm also seeking PhD opportunities for `Fall 2026`.
