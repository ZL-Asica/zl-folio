Parallel to my academic pursuits, I founded 'Beluga Subs': Recognizing the gap in subtitled digital content in China, especially in the realm of consumer electronics and cooking trilogy, I established a comprehensive supporting system from recruitment to publication.

In particular, I built a complete automated task information template combined with subtitles using Python and Node JS. It was a major breakthrough in using my programming skills to change lives and help my team. I also used Agile and KanBan to build a complete workflow for the team, allowing everyone to work while focusing on the translation itself and not on anything else. This initiative was a bridge connecting cultures, expanding to over 100 team members, and translating an average of 40 videos per week. In the past 5 years, we produced more than 20000 videos each average 6-8 minutes long. Also achieved more than 100K fans around differnt video platforms. With my humble effort, I contributed to breaking down digital barriers and fostering accessibility.
