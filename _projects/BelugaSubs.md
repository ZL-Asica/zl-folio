Parallel to my academic pursuits, I founded 'Beluga Subs': Recognizing the gap in subtitled digital content in China, especially in the realm of consumer electronics and cooking trilogy, I established a comprehensive supporting system from recruitment to publication.

I transitioned from using Python and Node JS to React Native, Material UI, Node.js, and Express.js to create a fully automated system that downloads subtitles, merges them into a predefined template, and aligns them with the audio to match the script accurately. This technological upgrade allowed us to streamline the subtitling process, significantly enhancing the efficiency of our workflow and ensuring high-quality results.

In addition, I employed Agile and Kanban methodologies to establish a robust workflow for the team, ensuring that everyone could focus solely on the translation process without distractions. This initiative served as a cultural bridge, expanding our team to over 100 members and enabling us to translate an average of 40 videos per week. Over the past five years, we produced more than 20,000 videos, each ranging from 6 to 8 minutes in length, and gained over 100,000 fans across various video platforms. Through my dedicated efforts, I contributed to breaking down digital barriers and promoting accessibility.
