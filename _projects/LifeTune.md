## 1. Problem Statement

“How might we develop a solution that minimizes data overwhelming for health-conscious users, providing motivational insights and personalized recommendations, such as indicating a current health score and suggesting small, actionable steps to seamlessly access real-time, precise, and user-friendly health status?”

## 2. Competitive Analysis

One of the most important steps in creating a solution is competitive analysis. It entails assessing the products, attributes, and shortcomings of current rivals in the industry to find openings and vulnerabilities. Findings from a competitive analysis may require more investigation through interviews. Following the identification of rivals, a number of factors are taken into consideration while evaluating their offerings, including user interface design, customization features, data integration, actionable insights, and user engagement tactics. This review aids in understanding the aspects of these items that consumers find appealing or unappealing. Recognize users' pain spots, experiences with current solutions, and desired features in a health management platform.

## 3. User Research Plan Summary

- **Technology developers** with experience in health apps, offering perspectives on feature importance and technological feasibility.
- **Techno-haters**, those skeptical of health technology, to understand their concerns and develop more user-friendly solutions.

### 3.2 Interview Focus Areas

The interviews aim to explore:

- **Awareness and Usage**: Familiarity with and usage of health-tracking apps.
