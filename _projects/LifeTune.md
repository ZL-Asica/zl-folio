## Problem Statement

“How might we develop a solution that minimizes data overwhelming for health-conscious users, providing motivational insights and personalized recommendations, such as indicating a current health score and suggesting small, actionable steps to seamlessly access real-time, precise, and user-friendly health status?”

## Competitive Analysis

One of the most important steps in creating a solution is competitive analysis. It entails assessing the products, attributes, and shortcomings of current rivals in the industry to find openings and vulnerabilities. Findings from a competitive analysis may require more investigation through interviews. Following the identification of rivals, a number of factors are taken into consideration while evaluating their offerings, including user interface design, customization features, data integration, actionable insights, and user engagement tactics. This review aids in understanding the aspects of these items that consumers find appealing or unappealing. Recognize users' pain spots, experiences with current solutions, and desired features in a health management platform.

## Storyboard

The user's initial dissatisfaction, the quest for a solution, their interaction with the app's feature, and the successful conclusion are all captured in the storyboard. It is based on information from Annie's interviews on the need for automation and simplicity while tracking dietary habits. The story is motivated by the widespread user desire for a simple, user-friendly method of managing nutritional objectives, which directly relates to the opinions expressed by every respondent regarding the significance of interaction and customization in health-tracking applications.
