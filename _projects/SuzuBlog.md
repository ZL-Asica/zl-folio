## Background

After years of frustration with the maintenance, security risks, and performance issues of other frameworks (such as Hexo, Jekyll, Typecho, WordPress), I decided to create Suzu Blog using Next.js. It is simple, efficient, and highly customizable, designed for anyone looking to build a modern blog quickly.

## Project Overview

SuzuBlog strives to combine **aesthetic simplicity** with **technical excellence**, creating a platform tailored for personal and professional bloggers who value both **form and function**. Inspired by elements of traditional Japanese design, the blog offers:

- **🚀 Next.js Powered** – Supports ISR & SSG for lightning-fast performance.
- **📄 Markdown Support** – Code highlighting with copy button, LaTeX rendering, optimized images, and elegant styling.
- **🔍 SEO Ready** – Auto-generates sitemap, Open Graph, Twitter Cards, and more.
- **🌍 Multi-Language** – Supports English, Chinese, Japanese, and more via `config.yml`.
- **📺 Anime List** – Fetch & display anime info from AniList API.
- **🌓 Dark Mode** – Adapts to system preferences seamlessly.
- **📢 RSS Feed** – Auto-generated RSS for easy content distribution.
- **♿ Accessibility First** – Semantic HTML, ARIA support, WCAG-compliant colors.

SuzuBlog is crafted to be a platform that grows alongside its users, balancing simplicity with flexibility. Feedback from early users will play a crucial role in shaping the evolution of this project. 🌸
